# sql-challenge
This is my solution to homework #9 for data bootcamp

# Overview
For this project, I will be working with six different CSV tables with employee data for Pewlett Hackard. To start I will use Quick DataBase Diagrams to help map out the CSV tables and how they connect. I will then add the columns and their types (string, integer, etc..). I will also add in the primary and foreign keys at this step. I will export the information from Quick DataBase Diagrams into pgAdmin to create the tables in SQL and importing the CSV data into the tables. Using SQL I will make queries for specific information about the employees.
